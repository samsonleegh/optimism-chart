# SG Optimism Charts

Optimism-channel charts and BUY / HOLD / SELL signals for SG (SGX) stocks.

## What it does
For each stock, on a **log-price** chart over 10 years it fits a straight,
**parallel** trend channel (a parallel-channel optimism method):

| Line | How it's drawn |
|------|---------|
| **50%** (P50) | **drawn first** — least-squares regression line through log-price (the central "fair value" trend; it balances the area above and below) |
| **100%** (P100) | **parallel** to P50, lifted to rest on the **peaks** (expensive) |
| **0%** (P0) | **parallel** to P50, dropped to rest on the **troughs** (cheap) |
| **75% / 25%** | midway P50↔P100 and P0↔P50 |

All five lines share **one slope**, so the channel is parallel. P100/P0 are
anchored on **≥2 peaks/troughs that are ≥~6 months apart**, so a single
speculative spike doesn't set the channel (a conservative fit). Tune
`PEAK_MIN_SEP_WEEKS` / `N_ANCHORS` in `optimism.py`.

The latest price's position in the channel = **optimism %** (0% at P0, 100% at
P100, linear in log-price). `≤25%` → **BUY**, `≥75%` → **SELL**, else **HOLD**.

Each stock's chart page shows the **10-year** channel and, below it, a **1-year
(short-term)** channel (same parallel-channel method, daily data, peaks/troughs
≥~6 weeks apart) — a long- and short-term read.

> Axis note: "log-log" was requested, but the trend model is exponential growth,
> which is a straight line on a **log-price axis vs linear time** (semi-log).
> A log time axis would only straighten power-law growth. Change in `make_chart`.

Two market tabs: **🇸🇬 Singapore** and **🇺🇸 United States**.

## 🧠 Smart Money tab (experimental)
A separate **Smart Money Scoreboard** tab tries out a different idea: ranking
stocks by **buying vs selling pressure** instead of long-run valuation.

True "successful ask vs bid volume" (volume that transacts at the ask = aggressive
buying, vs at the bid = aggressive selling) is tick / order-flow data and is **not**
in the free Yahoo feed. So it's **approximated from each daily OHLCV bar** by where
the close sits in the day's range (`smartmoney.buy_sell_volume`):

```
buy_fraction = (Close - Low) / (High - Low)   # closed near the high -> bought up
buy_volume   = Volume * buy_fraction          # proxy "successful ask volume"
sell_volume  = Volume * (1 - buy_fraction)    # proxy "successful bid volume"
```

Rolled up with classic accumulation indicators (Chaikin Money Flow, A/D line, OBV,
relative volume) and trend/momentum (EMA20/50, MACD, RSI) into two 0–100 scores:

- **Smart Money Score** — overall buy/sell pressure → **BUY ≥ 65 · SELL ≤ 40**.
- **Accumulation Score** — volume/flow only (is smart money quietly accumulating?).
- **⭐ High-conviction** when the score ≥ 85.

The board ranks every name strongest→weakest, shows a **Market Risk Meter**
(🟢/🟡/🔴 from STI trend, VIX, overnight S&P), and each stock links to a detail
page with an ATR-based **next-day trading plan** (entry zone, breakout, stop,
T1/T2, risk/reward). Tune weights/thresholds at the top of `smartmoney.py`.

> These are **heuristics on delayed daily data**, not an order-book feed.
> Reported block trades and the closing-auction tape (in the original wishlist)
> aren't available from the free source, so they're omitted rather than faked.
> **Not investment advice.**

## Run locally (live server)
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
.venv/bin/pip install -r requirements.txt
.venv/bin/python optimism.py     # one-off: writes ocbc_optimism.png
.venv/bin/python app.py          # dashboard at http://127.0.0.1:5000
```
Split-cadence background worker (in `app.py`):
- **Channels** (10y fit) re-computed **daily** — slow, barely moves intraday.
- **Prices + optimism % + charts** refreshed every **15 min** — a cheap quote per stock.

Tune `PRICE_REFRESH_MINUTES` / `CHANNEL_REFRESH_HOURS` at the top of `app.py`.

## Deploy free on GitHub Pages (static)
Pages can't run Flask, so a scheduled Action regenerates a **static snapshot**
(`build_static.py` → `site/`) and publishes it. Steps:
1. Push this repo to GitHub.
2. Repo **Settings → Pages → Source: GitHub Actions**.
3. `.github/workflows/pages.yml` then builds on every push and every ~30 min.

Build the static site locally too: `.venv/bin/python build_static.py` → open `site/index.html`.

> Scheduled Actions use a cron but are best-effort and often delayed under GitHub
> load — treat "every 30 min" as approximate, not a guaranteed live feed. For a
> truly live 15-min dashboard, run `app.py` on an always-on host (Render/Railway/Fly).

## Files
- `optimism.py`     — engine: fit channel (`fit_channel`), evaluate price (`evaluate`), chart PNG (`make_chart`).
- `smartmoney.py`   — Smart Money engine: ask/bid volume proxy (`buy_sell_volume`), scoreboard (`analyze`), risk meter (`market_risk`).
- `tickers.py`      — `MARKETS` = SG + US universes. Add `(ticker, name)` pairs to widen.
- `app.py`          — live Flask dashboard, tabs, split-cadence scheduler.
- `build_static.py` — static-site generator for GitHub Pages.
- `.github/workflows/pages.yml` — scheduled build + deploy to Pages.

## Caveats
- Data is Yahoo Finance (`.SI`), end-of-period and delayed — not a live feed.
- Prices are **nominal** (not dividend-adjusted), so a 10y channel reflects the
  price chart you'd recognise, not total return.
- This is a valuation heuristic, **not investment advice**.
